Recipe

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
Lightly grease the pan (loaf pan, mini loaf pan, 8x8-inch or 9x9-inch square pan, round pan) with some butter. Mix the flour and the baking powder together and sieve. Add in the salt and mix well. Set aside.
Use an electronic hand mixer or stand mixer to beat the butter and sugar until well combined or pale yellow in color, about 3 minutes.
Add in the first egg. Beat well after each addition of egg until creamy, about 1 to 2 minutes after adding each egg.
Scrape down the sides for even mixing. Add in the vanilla extract and mix well. Fold in the flour and mix well. Add in the plain yogurt or whole milk
Pour the batter into the greased baking pan. Shake it lightly to distribute the cake batter evenly. Bake until golden brown and cooked, about 40 - 50 minutes. To prevent the top of the cake from over browning, cover the top of the baking pan with a sheet of aluminum foil once the cake top is set. Use a cake tester to test doneness.
Remove it from the oven and let cool on the wire rack for 5 minutes. Cut into pieces and serve warm.
